## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between stock liquidity and corporate future investment decisions. By analyzing financial data and liquidity metrics, the study aims to understand how liquidity influences corporate investment behavior, providing insights into financial management and strategic planning.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Examination of financial datasets to assess stock liquidity and investment patterns.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Application of statistical methods to identify correlations between liquidity and investment decisions.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of findings to illustrate key trends and relationships.
- **Comprehensive Report**: Detailed documentation of methodologies, analyses, and conclusions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `statsmodels` for statistical modeling.
